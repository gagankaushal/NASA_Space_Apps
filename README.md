# VR-Planet-Educator

A game to simulate an educational experience on creating habitable solar systems

Please open "HomePage.html" to submit survey and start playing the game.

The survey would help us identify the star and planets in which people are most interested in and accordingly add more relevant information for the same.
In future, we would utilse this data to predict and send specific information belonging to a particular people using machine learning.

A virtual experience that puts the user on scale with a solar system to demonstrate the changes to the habitable zone around multiple stars. y doing so we try to combine NASAâ€™s exploration mission with the users ability to explore our virtual solar system.
